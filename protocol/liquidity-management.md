# Liquidity Management

This document describes how liquidity is managed for futarchy markets.

It covers both current operational practices and planned protocol-level mechanisms for managing DAO-owned liquidity.

> This section is under active development.

For a DAO-operator view of liquidity sourcing, thresholds, and custody patterns, see the **[DAO Integration Guide](../dao/integration.md)** and the **[Sponsored Proposals](../dao/sponsorship.md)** program description.
