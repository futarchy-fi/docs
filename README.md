# Futarchy Labs Docs

Welcome to the Futarchy Labs documentation.

Futarchy Labs is a governance platform that uses **conditional token markets** to evaluate governance decisions.

Instead of voting directly on them, participants trade on **counterfactual versions of a project’s token**, depending on whether a proposal is approved or not.

Prices reflect participants’ beliefs **at the time a decision is made**, rather than being settled based on outcomes observed later. The resulting prices provide an incentive-aligned signal about which decisions are expected to create value.
