# Futarchy Adoption Levels

Futarchy can be adopted step by step. DAOs don‚Äôt need to jump straight to full autonomy ‚Äî each level adds more integration and confidence.

---

## Level 0 ‚Äî Milestone Futarchy

**What it is:**  
Markets estimate the impact of specific milestones (e.g. ‚ÄúLaunch Feature X by Q3‚Äù) on token price.

**DAO role:**  
- Provide liquidity for milestone markets.  
- Use results as *signals only*.  

**Benefits:**  
- Easiest entry point, low governance friction.  
- Quick way to test futarchy in practice.

## Level 1 ‚Äî Advisory Futarchy

**What it is:**  
Every major proposal runs through futarchy evaluation (YES vs NO).  
The outcome guides tokenholder voting.

**DAO role:**  
- Seed liquidity in YES/NO markets.  
- Display futarchy recommendations in Snapshot or on-chain UI.

**Benefits:**  
- Increases tokenholder confidence.  
- Prevents harmful proposals from moving forward without strong evidence.  

**Risks:**  
- Delegates may still choose to ignore futarchy advice (cultural adjustment needed).

## Level 2 ‚Äî Sponsored Futarchy

**What it is:**  
Outside sponsors (activist investors) propose changes and bond capital.  
If futarchy approves, sponsors can buy DAO tokens at a discount (vested).

**DAO role:**  
- Define rules for sponsorship (bond, discount %, vesting).  
- Commit to honoring futarchy-approved sponsored proposals.  

**Benefits:**  
- Brings **new capital and new ideas** into the DAO.  
- Aligns incentives between sponsors and tokenholders.  

**Risks:**  
- Needs safeguards against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù proposals.

## Level 3 ‚Äî FAO (Futarchy Autonomous Organization)

**What it is:**  
A special on-chain governor (FAO) directly controls treasury or parameters.  
It executes futarchy-approved proposals automatically.

**DAO role:**  
- Deploy the FAO contract with defined scope.  
- Gradually expand its authority as confidence grows.

**Benefits:**  
- Full autonomy, credibly neutral governance.  
- Scales decision-making beyond human bottlenecks.

**Risks:**  
- Cultural resistance to ceding authority to code.  
- Must choose metrics carefully to avoid Goodhart effects.
