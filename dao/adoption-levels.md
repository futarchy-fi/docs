# Futarchy Adoption Levels

Futarchy can be adopted step by step. DAOs don‚Äôt need to jump straight to full autonomy ‚Äî each level adds more integration and confidence.  
**We recommend DAOs start with Advisory Futarchy (proposal evaluation) as the default entry point.**  
Milestone markets can run in parallel as an optional complement.

---

## Advisory Futarchy (Recommended First Step)

**What it is:**  
Every major proposal runs through futarchy evaluation (YES vs NO).  
The outcome provides a **market-based recommendation** that guides tokenholder voting.

**DAO role:**  
- Seed liquidity in YES/NO markets.  
- Display futarchy recommendations in Snapshot or on-chain UI.  

**Benefits:**  
- Increases tokenholder confidence.  
- Prevents harmful proposals from moving forward without evidence.  
- Minimal disruption to existing governance process.

**Risks:**  
- Delegates may initially ignore futarchy advice (cultural adjustment needed).

## Milestone Futarchy (Optional Complement)

**What it is:**  
Markets estimate the impact of specific roadmap milestones (e.g. ‚ÄúLaunch Feature X by Q3‚Äù) on token price.  
Milestones provide *extra signals* to validate execution, but are not required to adopt futarchy.

**DAO role:**  
- Provide liquidity for milestone markets.  
- Use results as additional advisory signals.  

**Benefits:**  
- Supplements proposal futarchy with roadmap accountability.  
- Helps track whether execution is adding value.

## Level 2 ‚Äî Sponsored Futarchy

**What it is:**  
Outside sponsors (activist investors) propose changes and bond capital.  
If futarchy approves, sponsors can buy DAO tokens at a discount (vested).

**DAO role:**  
- Define rules for sponsorship (bond, discount %, vesting).  
- Commit to honoring futarchy-approved sponsored proposals.  

**Benefits:**  
- Brings **new capital and new ideas** into the DAO.  
- Aligns incentives between sponsors and tokenholders.  

**Risks:**  
- Needs safeguards against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù proposals.

## Level 3 ‚Äî FAO (Futarchy Autonomous Organization)

**What it is:**  
A special on-chain governor (FAO) directly controls treasury or parameters.  
It executes futarchy-approved proposals automatically.

**DAO role:**  
- Deploy the FAO contract with defined scope.  
- Gradually expand its authority as confidence grows.

**Benefits:**  
- Full autonomy, credibly neutral governance.  
- Scales decision-making beyond human bottlenecks.

**Risks:**  
- Cultural resistance to ceding authority to code.  
- Must choose metrics carefully to avoid Goodhart effects.

## Which path should your DAO choose?

- **Default entry point:** Advisory futarchy for proposals.  
- **Optional supplement:** Milestone futarchy for roadmap accountability.  
- **Expand later:** Sponsored futarchy to attract capital and ideas.  
- **Long-term vision:** FAO for fully autonomous governance.
